            <p>
              My name is <strong>Jamell Fields Jr</strong>. I’m currently a senior at
              <strong>Northern Kentucky University</strong>, majoring in
              <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> with a focus in communications. I’m interested in how
              technology, security, and people all connect, and I’m working toward a career where I
              can help protect systems and data while clearly communicating risks and solutions.
            </p>

          <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h4">Service &amp; Background</h2>
            <p>
              I serve in the <strong>Kentucky National Guard</strong> and have been in for almost
              four years. That experience has taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to stay calm
              and focused when things get stressful. Balancing military service with school has
              pushed me to manage my time well and stay committed to my goals.

          <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h4">Student Life</h2>
            <p>
              At NKU, I’ve been building a foundation in cybersecurity concepts, networking, and
              system administration, along with communication skills that are just as important in
              the real world. I like working on hands-on labs and projects that feel practical and
              match what I might do in an actual IT or security role.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="h4">Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of class and the Guard, I try to stay active and enjoy my time with friends
              and family. Some of my favorite things to do include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Going out to different places, like games or movies, and exploring new spots</li>
              <li>Walking my dogs and spending time with them outdoors</li>
              <li>Playing sports with friends and staying competitive in a fun way</li>
              <li>Going on trips and getting out of the usual routine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Those things help me reset, stay grounded, and bring some balance to everything I’m
              working on in school and life.
